Basic Image Classification Model – Two-Category Image Identifier (Custom ML Project)
Simplify image recognition tasks with this lightweight Image Classification Model, designed to accurately identify and label images into one of two custom categories. Ideal for beginners and developers exploring computer vision, this two-part project includes full training and testing notebooks, making it easy to understand and deploy.

Built using TensorFlow/Keras in Python, this model can classify images into two distinct classes (e.g., Cats vs. Dogs, or any two user-defined objects), based on the image content.

What’s Included:

 1)Training Notebook:

Prepares image datasets from two folders

Builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Trains the model on labeled data with accuracy tracking

Saves the trained model for later use

2)Testing Notebook:

Loads saved model

Accepts new image inputs

Predicts and displays the image label (based on the two categories)

Key Features:

Binary image classification (works with any two image types)

Clear training and testing pipeline in Jupyter

Simple, efficient CNN architecture

Perfect for beginners learning AI, ML, or computer vision basics

Use Cases: Educational demos, ML tutorials, hobby projects, or prototyping simple image recognition tools.

Bring machine learning to life by teaching your model to recognize and name images with this beginner-friendly, two-class image classifier!
